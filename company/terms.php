            <strong>Arbitration.</strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. For any claim, dispute, or controversy between you and us that arises out of, is related to or in connection with these Terms (individually a "Claim" and
            collectively "Claims"), you agree to first contact us at zogunhee@naver.com and attempt to resolve the Claim informally. We hope we can resolve any Claim with you. In the unlikely event that you and Monster&nbsp;Form have not been able to resolve
            the Claim within sixty (60) days after you contact us, then you and we each agree to resolve the Claim by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for
            Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except for any and all Claims related to injunctive or other equitable relief and/or any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our
            licensors’ Intellectual Property Rights (discussed below):
            <ol>
              <li>The extent that arbitration clauses are prohibited by applicable law in jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>
              <li>You may file a Claim in small claims court if the Claim meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</li>
            </ol>
            You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
            applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless you and we expressly agree otherwise. If your Claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, we agree that
            you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your Claim is for more than U.S.
            $10,000, the right to a hearing, payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses will be governed by the AAA rules. If we commence an arbitration, we will pay for all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. In any
            arbitration,
            the prevailing party will not seek to recover attorney’s fees or expenses unless the arbitrator finds the Claim to be frivolous or for an improper purpose. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security,
            Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE FILING PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS
            Monster&nbsp;Form AGREES OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Monster&nbsp;Form ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
            CLASS ACTION. If the
            class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 19 is
            found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 19 still applies.

            "Entitlements" means your entitlements to use the Service (such as your membership and subscription rights, maximum capacity, transactions, output, hours or other measurements of use, term or duration and any other entitlements specific to such
            Service) as determined by the type or level of membership or subscription you subscribed to or licensed. "Entitlements" also include any other information about entitlements to access and use the Service which are set forth on the Service

            <strong>Changes or Updates to these Terms.</strong> If you don’t agree with any material changes or updates we make to these Terms, you must notify us of that fact by sending an email to us at <a
              href="mailto:zogunhee@naver.com.com">zogunhee@naver.com</a> within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the change ("Effective Date"). Notifying us in this way will terminate the updated terms and conditions as to your use of the
            Service and the terms and conditions that apply to you will be the terms and conditions in effect immediately before the change (unless the change made was made to comply with applicable law) and those terms and conditions will be in effect until
            (i) the end of the then-current term identified in your Entitlements, or (ii) thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever is earlier (the "End Date"). The End Date will be the end of the term of your Service including your Entitlements.
            Unless you notify us within 30 days as set forth
            above, your continued use of the Service after the Effective Date will be deemed an acceptance of these changes and a renewal and extension of the Terms in effect at the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any changes to these Terms
            will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised version of these Terms incorporating such changes or otherwise notified you of such changes.
