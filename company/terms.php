        <strong>Arbitration.</strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. For any claim, dispute, or controversy between you and us that arises out of, is related to or in connection with these Terms (individually a "Claim" and
        collectively "Claims"), you agree to first contact us at zogunhee@naver.com and attempt to resolve the Claim informally. We hope we can resolve any Claim with you. In the unlikely event that you and Monster&nbsp;Form have not been able to resolve
        the Claim within sixty (60) days after you contact us, then you and we each agree to resolve the Claim by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for
        Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except for any and all Claims related to injunctive or other equitable relief and/or any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our
        licensors’ Intellectual Property Rights (discussed below):
        <ol>
          <li>The extent that arbitration clauses are prohibited by applicable law in jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>
          <li>You may file a Claim in small claims court if the Claim meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</li>
        </ol>
        You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
        applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless you and we expressly agree otherwise. If your Claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, we agree that
        you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your Claim is for more than U.S.
        $10,000, the right to a hearing, payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses will be governed by the AAA rules. If we commence an arbitration, we will pay for all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. In any
        arbitration,
        the prevailing party will not seek to recover attorney’s fees or expenses unless the arbitrator finds the Claim to be frivolous or for an improper purpose. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security,
        Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE FILING PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS
        Monster&nbsp;Form AGREES OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Monster&nbsp;Form ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
        CLASS ACTION. If the
        class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 19 is
        found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 19 still applies.

            <strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong> Subject to the other terms and conditions of these Terms, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration shall be

            The laws of such jurisdictions will govern without reference to the conflicts-of-laws rules thereof. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act will not apply to
            (and are excluded from the laws governing) these Terms. In addition, you agree that any claim, action or dispute arising under or relating to these Terms will be brought exclusively in (and the parties will be subject to the exclusive
            jurisdiction of) the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Marin, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, except that if you are registered with the Service in a country in
            Europe, Africa or the Middle East, any such claim or dispute will be brought exclusively in (and the parties will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of) the courts of Switzerland, or a country in Asia, Oceania or the Asia-Pacific
            region, any such claim or
            dispute will be brought exclusively in (and the parties will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of) the courts of Singapore. Nothing in the foregoing will prevent us from bringing an action for infringement of intellectual property
            rights in any country where such infringement is alleged to occur.

        association, partnership, joint venture or other relationship. Each party will be responsible for covering their respective costs and expenses in performing their duties under these Terms, unless expressly provided otherwise herein. If for any
        reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms, or any portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of these Terms and the
        remainder of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. The section headings used in these Terms are for convenience only and will not be given any substantive effect. The English language version of these Terms is legally binding in

        expressly provided herein, a party may only waive its rights under these Terms by a written document executed by both parties. Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision
        hereof. You may not assign or delegate these Terms or any of your rights or obligations hereunder. Any unauthorized assignment will be null and void. You acknowledge and agree that we may assign or sub-contract any of its rights or obligations
